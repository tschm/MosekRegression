# MosekTools
#### Building tools on the shoulders of [Mosek](http://www.mosek.com).


## Motivation

We created this package to support the experiments given in the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3397) 
by Schmelzer, Hauser, Dahl and Andersen. 


## License

If you have a valid Mosek license you may want to edit the Dockerfile and adjust the definition of the environment variable in there.

## Applications

You can solve various (un)constrained regression and Markowitz problems.
